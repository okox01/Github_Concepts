# **Connecting VS Code to GitHub and Uploading Files**

# **1. Set Up Git on Your Local Machine**:
# - Install Git: https://git-scm.com/
# - Configure Git with your name and email:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

# **2. Open VS Code**:
# - Open your project folder in VS Code.

# **3. Initialize a Git Repository**:
# - Open the terminal in VS Code and run:
git init

# **4. Add a Remote Repository**:
# - Create a repository on GitHub and copy the URL.
# - Link it with your local project:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git

# **5. Add Files to Staging Area**:
# - Add all files to the staging area:
git add .

# **6. Commit the Changes**:
# - Commit the staged files with a message:
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# **7. Push Changes to GitHub**:
# - Push the commits to GitHub:
git push -u origin main

# **Common Exceptions & Solutions**

# **1. fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories**:
# - Cause: Your local and remote repositories have different histories.
# - Solution: Use --allow-unrelated-histories when pulling:
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# **2. error: src refspec main does not match any**:
# - Cause: No commits in your local repository.
# - Solution: Add and commit files before pushing:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# **3. Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally**:
# - Cause: The remote has changes you donâ€™t have locally.
# - Solution: Pull the changes and merge them:
git pull origin main

# **4. error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/...'**:
# - Cause: Your local branch is behind the remote branch.
# - Solution: Pull updates first:
git pull origin main
# Then push again:
git push origin main

# **5. Permission Denied (publickey)**:
# - Cause: SSH keys are missing or incorrect.
# - Solution: Switch to HTTPS:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
